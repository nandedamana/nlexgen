----------
* tests-auto: check token length also. some tests got passed incorrectly due to the lack of this.

----------
* Go back to the tree unit-testing and add unit testing.

2020-11-29
----------
* More separation needed between internal symbols and symbols for applications. Currently the `nan_` prefix means internal only, but they are found in headers intended for applications also.

----------
* In main.c, I've written "/* Nobody cares about first_child or sibling of an action node. */" and I still set them?

UNKNOWN DT
----------

- Handle duplicate rules (currently no error or warning; possibly memory leak also).

----------
- TODO improve: since I've removed the cyclic buffer today, there needs a feature to flush the buffer or limit the go-back area so that the user can save memroy.
- TODO improve: echo -e "b* A\nb B"|./lexgen would cause a tree with duplicate nodes.

----------
- Option to use another name instead of 'nh' (NlexHandle instance) and 'ch' (ch is equivalent to nh->last(), but a separate variable may increase performance, I think).

-------
* IMPORTANT use static allocation for nstack and tstack (I can predict the size, right?)
	- what about a state getting pushed multiple times?
* instead of the current nesting in state comparison, can I use something like binary search, WITHOUT BREAKING PRIORITY?
* remove the on-the-go tree simplification parts (like reusing a node) from the tree construction phase.
* remove the tree visit-unvisit system since the tree isn't cyclic anymore?
* doc: beware of the maximal munch issue: use "[^"]*" (simple example without support for escaping) instead of ".*" or all tokens after the string will get discarded. See this in action by editing tests-auto/comment-multiline.nlx

* TODO lexer loops in test files: remove EOF check now that nlexgen generates it.

* nh.lastmatchat and nh.curtokpos now use int instead of size_t to store negatives without ambiguity. make sure no overflow occurs and the buffer is prevented from growing larger than these can represent.
